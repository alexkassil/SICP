My work for the different exercises present in the great book, Structures and Interpretations of Computer Programs (SICP)

I am also working through the [Fall 2010 Berkeley CS61A course](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa10/], completing the labs and projects.

The redoing is to both review scheme for teaching CS61A in Fa19, and to get to the later material that I never got to previously.
